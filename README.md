### Projects

#### Inventory and Job Application Tracker in Excel
1. Initial project idea: I created this project to solve two problems: tracking inventory better and keeping job applications organized. I often lose track of stock or forget job details, so this project helps fix that.
2. Tools I used: What tools did you use in completing this project? I used Excel with formulas like SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, and COUNT. I also used IF statements, absolute/mixed referencing, conditional formatting, and added hyperlinks for resumes and cover letters.
3. Challenges I faced: What challenges did you face, and how? What obstacles did you overcome? It was tricky to use Excel functions in a way that made sense and didn’t clutter the sheets. Getting the formatting right and making the layout clean was also a bit of a challenge.
4. Other Resources: Did you use any other resources? Did you collaborate with anyone to get this done? 
I watched class videos, looked up a few Excel tips online, and asked a friend for feedback on the layout. I made everything myself without using any templates.
5. Result: What did you set out to achieve? Did you achieve it? What improvements would you like to make if you had a chance to take this further? 
create a useful, real-world tool that makes it easier to manage products and job applications in one workbook. I did achieve that. If I had to  make any improvements I would integrate it  with Outlook/Google Calendar for application reminders and follow-ups.
6. Summary: A dual-purpose Excel workbook combining inventory tracking and job application management using formulas, logic, and formatting to solve everyday organizational challenges creatively and efficiently.

####  Academic Research and Resource Curation
1. Initial project idea: I chose a topic I was interested in and also had strong research potential. The ultimate goal was to find credible academic sources and begin building a foundation for a well-researched paper. I needed to solve the problem of gathering reliable, relevant information from scholarly sources.
2. Tools I used: I used the college library database (Seeker) to do an advanced search on my topic as well as Google Scholar to find additional sources through the “Cited By” feature. My OneDrive Academic Research folder was used to save PDFs and permalinks.
3. Challenges I faced: One challenge was narrowing down my search terms to get useful, focused results. At first, I got too many unrelated articles. I fixed this by adjusting my search filters and using keywords more strategically. Another challenge was identifying which cited articles were relevant.
4. Other Resources: I used the research videos and guides from class to help with database searches. I didn’t work with anyone directly, but I followed all the steps and instructions provided by the module closely
5. Result: I set out to find high-quality, academic articles for use in my annotated bibliography and later assignments. I achieved this by using advanced search methods and selecting articles based on citations. If I could improve the project, I’d dig deeper into newer articles to ensure I have the most up-to-date research.
6. Summary: This project helped me build strong academic research skills by selecting a topic, finding scholarly articles, and organizing sources for an upcoming annotated bibliography and research paper.

#### Jdoodle and StudentCard/Exponent Calculator 
1. Initial Project Idea: I created this project to help students easily display their academic info and perform exponent calculations using simple Python programs.
2. Tools I Used: I used JDoodle and Python to write and test my code.
3. Challenges I Faced: I faced issues with input formatting and typecasting, which I solved by testing and using comments for clarity.
4. Other Resources: I used Python documentation and tested the code with help from classmates for feedback.
5. Result: I achieved my goal, and I would improve the programs by adding more features like input validation and multiple student entries.
6. Summary: This project includes two beginner Python tools—a student info card and exponent calculator—designed to practice basic input, output, and operations.
